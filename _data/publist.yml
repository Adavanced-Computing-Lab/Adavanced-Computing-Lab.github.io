- title: "Detecting Privacy Threats with Machine Learning: A Design Framework for Identifying Side-Channel Risks of Illegitimate User Profiling"
  year: 2023
  description: "Data-intensive systems are vulnerable to side-channel attacks in which hackers can extract sensitive information from a digital device without actively manipulating the target system. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of IS research on how businesses can effectively detect and safeguard against side-channel attacks."

  description: "Our key idea is to leverage the way AI algorithms pre-process various traffic events in guiding driversâ€™ actions. By providing scenario-specific feedback, such an approach can integrate the decision process of a driver with that of the algorithmic aid."

  description: "We propose MalRNN, a novel deep learning-based approach to automatically generate evasive malware variants without any of these restrictions. Our approach features an adversarial example generation process, which learns a language model via a generative sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network to augment malware binaries. MalRNN effectively evades three recent deep learning-based malware detectors and outperforms current benchmark methods."
