  description: "Driver distraction caused by over-reliance on automotive technology is one of the leading causes of accidents in semi-autonomous vehicles. We identify the relationship between the traffic event, the type of automotive sensing technologies, and its processing resources to capture that event to design the driver's attention gauge."

  description: "Data-intensive systems are vulnerable to side-channel attacks in which hackers can extract sensitive information from a digital device without actively manipulating the target system. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of IS research on how businesses can effectively detect and safeguard against side-channel attacks."

- title: "Binary Black-box Evasion Attacks Against Deep Learning-based Static Malware Detectors with Adversarial Byte-Level Language Model"
  year: 2020

  description: "We propose MalRNN, a novel deep learning-based approach to automatically generate evasive malware variants without any of these restrictions. Our approach features an adversarial example generation process, which learns a language model via a generative sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network to augment malware binaries. MalRNN effectively evades three recent deep learning-based malware detectors and outperforms current benchmark methods."
